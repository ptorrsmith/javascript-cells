# javascript-cells


* a number of large cells (circles) on the screen, each of different size, colour
* each cell contains a number of cells, that can each contain a number of cells.  
* we can see the cells inside the main cells (medium), and the cells inside them (small).
* If we go into a cell, it gets largers and we can see the cells inside them, and those inside them larger 
* The cells peers would now shrink.
* If we go into a child cell, then the parent cell is now the universe and its peers are not visible (but on radar / family tree, to look out)
* Can back out to go to higher view and reveal neighbour cells
* Cells proximity is proportional to its size (gravitational pull)
* Can view as tree
